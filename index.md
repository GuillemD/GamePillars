# Introduction

My name is Guillem Dominguez and I'm currently studying Video Games development and design at Universitat Polit√®cnica de Catalunya (UPC).
For the Project 2 subject I was asked to do research work about Game Pillars, so it would help in our next projects and games.

## Game Pillars

A game pillar is a simple idea or element that defines what is most important in our games.
It helps the teams during the development phase to have a clear idea of the guidelines of the game, being able to keep a better perspective over the project.

If you want to know more details about this topic, you can download a pdf file at my github (www.github.com/GuillemD/GamePillars) or you can download the latest release which also contains the pdf (https://github.com/GuillemD/GamePillars/releases/tag/v1.0)

### Contact

If you happen to encounter a mistake or a lack of information you can contact me by opening an issue in the repository, and I'll fix it as soon as possible.

Thank you for your attention
